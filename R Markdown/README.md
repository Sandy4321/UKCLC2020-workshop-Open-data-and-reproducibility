# R Markdown

## Tasks

- bugs.Rmd

    This is a debugging task, in which participants seek to find and resolve specific code errors. Clues for this can be found by opening an R Markdown script in RStudio, which creates a template that includes the YAML header and some examples of text formatting and R Markdown coding. By looking at that template, and by also following the workshop demo, participants can rise to this challenge.
